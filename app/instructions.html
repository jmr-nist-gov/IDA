<h4>Welcome to the Isotope Dilution Assistant (IDA).</h4>
<hr>
<p>This data processing tool reads the basic comma separated value file generated by [SOFTWARE] for isotopic measurements of inorganic analytes.  It was constructed to directly address the time-consuming process of manual manipulation of text files into a calculation spreadsheet and automates the process to rapidly calculate the mean, standard deviation, and relative standard deviation (RSD) of isotopic ratios.  The full code is available on GitHub at [URL] and runs within the RStudio environment to generate the web application you're using now.</p>

<p>
Using IDA is intended to be straight forward and simple.  If something could be improved, please contact IDA's custodian (see below).

	<li>
		<strong>Apply processing values to</strong> sets the values used by IDA to identify the signal stability region.  To understand and use IDA successfully, the point buffer size, RSD tolerance, and expansion size should be adjusted to best fit your data.  This can be applied to "All" or "Single Sample" as appropriate; "Single Sample" becomes the default once a data file is loaded.
		<ul>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Buffer size</strong> is the number of points to exclude from the beginning and ending of the stable measurement region.</li>
			<li><strong>Tolerance</strong> is the acceptable change in RSD used during identification of the stable measurement region.</li>
			<li><strong>Expansion size</strong> is the bin size for points included with each iteration to determine the signal ratio stability region.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		<strong>Select an instrument file</strong> by clicking "Browse..." or drag the instrument file to be processed directly to the "Browse..." button.  The file will be automatically processed according to the processing values set.  The "Details" tab under "Results" will be activated and contains:
		<ul>
			<br>
			<li>
			<strong>Quality Overview</strong> shows the RSDs of isotope ratio signals for each sample.  Samples in red exceeded the arbitrary threshold of 5% RSD.  Samples labeled as "blank" are shown in blue and are not included in the RSD ranges.  Click on any point to select that sample for further investigation.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Sample Investigation</strong> pairs instrument signal instensity and resulting isotope ratio plots as a function of time.  Red lines indicate the time range of the stability region.  Highlighting a portion of the ratio plot allows for manual adjustment of the time range by clicking on the button below.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Values</strong> are provided as a simple interactive table displaying the time, signal ratio, and signal intensity values (both raw and baseline corrected).
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Summary Results</strong> are located on another tab and contain the mean, 1sd, and RSD calculated from the instrument file.  Processing values including baseline intensities chosen, stability region start and end time, buffer size, tolerance level, and expansion size.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		<strong>Download results</strong> in a variety of ways: save only the parts necessary to carry your analysis forward or save the entire output produced by IDA.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		<strong>Archive</strong> stores or recalls objects created by IDA.  Any analysis that is archived will be available for future review.

<p>
Reported summary results for each sample in the input file include mean, one standard deviation (1SD), and percent relative standard deviation (RSD) of the signal ratio between two isotopes.  To accomplish this, IDA splits input data at the midpoint intensity of the signal trace and creates two sets to identify baseline (left hand portion) and stable signal regions (right hand portion).  Baseline subtraction is performed for each isotope after identification of the maximum signal density in the baseline region; performance may be hampered by signal drift as subtraction assumes a stable (i.e. flat) baseline.  The region of signal stability is identified beginning at the middle time point in the right portion of the split data.  The basic RSD is established from the 20 points nearest the central time point.  This is expanded over a number of points to the right and the resulting RSD is compared with the previous RSD; if the new RSD is within the tolerance range set by the user, those points are accepted.  When the RSD exceeds this tolerance threshold or reaches the end of the signal, points to the left of the midpoint are considered under the same circumstances.  Copies of the digital object for each application of IDA are saved to the application directory subfolder "Archive."

<p>
The current version of IDA supports only comparison of two isotopes in the input file; more may be added later.
