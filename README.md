# Isotope Dilution Assistant

_current version 0.9; last updated 20180202_

This data processing tool was constructed to directly address the time-consuming process of manual manipulation of text files into a calculation spreadsheet and automates the process to rapidly calculate the mean, standard deviation, and relative standard deviation (RSD) of isotopic ratios.  It reads the basic comma separated value file generated by [SOFTWARE] for isotopic measurements of inorganic analytes.  IDA is a Shiny application, currently intended to be run from a local copy of RStudio.  The interface allows for changing of parameters to identify the signal stability region and manual override by brushing directly on the signal ratio plots.  Additionally, it flags potentially troublesome samples for the user's attention.  For best results and to use all features, clone to an entirely local instance and run directly from RStudio.
